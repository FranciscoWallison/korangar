# Ragnarok Bytes

A crate that exposes traits an types to serialize and deserialize Ragnarok Online file formats and network packets.

All the `ragnarok-*` crates are meant to be independent from Korangar and have no dependencies to it, meaning they can be used for other Ragnarok Online related projects.
